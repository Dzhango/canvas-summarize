{ "text": "Yeah. Okay. All  right. Let's  go  ahead  and  get  started. Are  you  able  to  hear  me  okay? Yeah.  Okay,  good. Congratulations  on  all  finding  the  classroom. That  alone  is  already  an  accomplishment. Have  any  of  you  been  in  this  class before  this  specific  space? No.  Okay.  Yeah.  Same  for  me  as  you  can tell  from  my  completely  flustered  entry. Welcome  to  USP  one. This  is  the  introduction  to the  history  of  American  urban  communities. This  is  the  intro  level  class  to  the  USP  major  or  minor. Just  out  of  curiosity, can  you  raise  your  hand  if  you  are  a  USP  major  or  minor? Okay,  good.  The  vast  majority  of  you,  if  you're  not, hopefully  you'll  be  persuaded  to become  a  major  or  minor  by  the  end  of  the  cost. This  is  the  first  in  the  series, it  is  focused  specifically  on  US  content. The  second  in  the  series, USB  two  is  on  global  approaches  and  then the  third  is  on  the  connection between  cities  and  theories. That's  the  way  the  123  series  is  set  up. I'm  guessing  some  of  you  are taking  them  in  different  order. It  just  depends  on  your  schedule and  what  you  are  able  to  enroll  in. But  again,  this  is  really  primarily  a  US  class. And  I  say  that  because  a  lot  of  students  come into  this  class  hoping  for  global  examples. And  I'm  happy  to  provide  them. But  the  focus  will  really  be  on American  cities  and  American  context. Okay,  so  today  we're  going  to  be  doing a  little  bit  of  an  introduction  to  why  the  urban  matters, but  before  we  get  into  that, we're  going  to  get  into  the  actual logistics  of  the  class. So  one  thing  I'll  point  out  right away  with  the  way  that  my  slides  are organized  is  that  you'll see  every  time  when  you  walk  into  this  class. First  of  all,  the  PDF  version  of this  lecture  will  be  posted  on  Canvas  ahead  of  time. So  you  can  download  it  if  you'd  like. I  do  the  PDF  version  and not  the  Powerpoint  version because  the  file  size  is  too  big. So  that's  why.  So  if  you  need  a  different  version, I'm  afraid  I  can't  accommodate  you. Because  I've  tried  in  the  past and  it  just  crashes  canvas. So  it  will  be  a  PDF  version. There  will  always  be  an  agenda. And  then  you'll  notice  as  we  move  through  the  lecture, you'll  see  that  actually, well,  this  is  a  bad  example. But  you'll  see  that  in  the  top. I'll  actually  keep  track  of  where  we are  in  the  lecture  with  the  headings  at  the  top. I  don't  know  if  you  can  see  my  little  red  dot  there. The  headings  will  keep  you  sort  of informed  of  what  part  of  the  lecture  we're  in. Just  in  case  you  I  don't  know. Space  out  I  need  to  remember  or  you  just like  to  keep  track  of  the  lecture  in  that  way. All  right,  before  we  actually get  started  on  the  content  though,  like  I  said, I  think  we  need  to  go  over  the  actual  logistics of  the  class  and  introduce  ourselves  to  you. So  I'm  going  to  start  by  asking your  TAs  to  come  up  to  the  front  for  a  second. Hello  everyone.  I'm  Carey  Keith. I  am  a  Phd  candidate  in  the  Department  of  Communication, and  I'm  also  in the  Critical  Gender  Studies  Program  here  at  UCSD. My  research  is  broadly in  the  intersection  of  critical  geography and  prison  abolition. Critical  geography  is  probably  something  you  will become  acquainted  with  in urban  studies  and  planning  department. It  largely  looks  at the  production  of  space  and  understands space  as  more  lively  than  just  that. Which  yields  to  the  intention  of  designers  and  planners. I  focus  specifically  on  California  prison  history, and  I  look  at  prisoner resistance  movements  in  California. I  follow  the  history  of  insurgency  and counter  insurgency  in  the  development of  California  state  prisons. So,  that's  a  little  bit  about my  research  and  what  I  look  at. Yeah.  Hi  everyone.  So,  my  name  is  Ross  Graham. I  am  Sections  3.4  so  that's  the  11:00  A.M.  and  the  noon. I'm  a  sixth  year  in  the  sociology  department. I  just  got  back  from a  year  in  the  Bay  Area  doing  field  work. And  my  research  is  about the  public's  ethical  and  moral  commitments to  certain  kinds  of  risk that  have  high  degrees  of  uncertainty  to  them. So  I  look  a  lot  at  various  kinds of  environmental  issues  as  well  as various  issues  in  tech  and  biotech. And  this  is  my  fourth  class  or  fifth  class, I  think  I  in  USP? Yeah.  Looking  forward  to  meeting  your. Hey  everyone.  My  name  is  Bernardo  Mckenna. I'm  also  a  sixth  year  in  sociology. I'm  also  in  the  Computational  Social  Science  program. My  research  is  all  about  segregation,  which  again, is  probably  something  you  get  acquainted with  here  in  this  class  and  also  in  USP. More  or  less  what  I  do  is  I  try  to  understand  the  extent of  socio  economic  segregation and  also  other  forms  of  segregation. And  then  it's  consequences  for  social  cohesion. Yeah,  glad  to  be  here. I  actually  feel  really,  really  lucky  because  I got  a  really  all  star  team  of  TA's  this  quarter. The  most  seasoned  as  I  think  I've  ever  had,  sixth  years, I  actually  asked  them  to  talk  about their  research  because  I  think  it's  really  one of  the  benefits  of  being  at  UCSD  is you're  not  just  being  taught  by  people  who  love  to  teach, which  is  obviously  a  really  important  thing, but  you're  also  being  taught  by  researchers, people  who  are  here  because  we  love  research. Just  to  tell  you  a  little  bit  about  my  own  work, I'm  a  historian  by  training. Although  I've  also  done some  work  in  architecture  and  design, My  own  research  is  on homeownership  programs  and  in  particular, looking  at  global  homeownership  programs. Thinking  in  particular  about  the  intersections  of diplomacy  and  international  relations  and  housing. Specifically,  housing  finance. You'll  see  some  of  those  interests  coming  out in  some  of  the  lectures  on  housing  finance. I  also  am  currently  working  on  a  project  on urban  food  systems  and  the  relationship  between rural  agricultural  spaces  and  urban  development. Hopefully,  some  of  these  interests  between the  four  of  us  will  intersect  with  some  of  yours. I  think  it's  fair  to  say  that  we  all  are excited  to  talk  about  research  with  you  as  well. Okay.  All  right, so  the  course  requirements  now  onto  the  boring  part. Hopefully  you've  all  seen  the  canvas  site  by  now. But  if  you  haven't,  this  is  what  it  looks  like. Let  me  try  to  do  this  without showing  you  all  my  e  mails  and  text. Okay?  Oops.  Wrong  course  USP  one.  Here  we  go. Okay.  So  the  syllabus  is  listed  here. And  all  the  requirements  of  the  class, how  you'll  be  graded, et  cetera,  are  all  listed  on  that  site. The  first  part  that  I  want  to  really emphasize  is  this  is  a  class  that  clickers. Now  I  know  that  it's  annoying  to have  to  buy  the  little  clicker  machine. I  actually  tried  it,  I think  it  was  last  year  with  the  app. And  it  was  a  disaster  because  it  kept failing  and  scores  were  not  going  incorrectly. So  I'm  afraid  that  it  is a  physical  click  on  system  for  this  particular  class. However,  my  students  tell  me  you can  sell  it  again  at  the  end. And  I  know  a  lot  of  classes  at  UCSD  use  them. Do  you  have  any  questions  about  the  clickers? Yeah,  that's  a  good  question. It  looks  like  a  1980s  remote  control. You  buy  it  at  the  student  store  down  in  the  main  section, and  then  you  actually  go  into  here  and  you see  the  clicker  registration  button.  You  click  on  it. I'm  not  going  to  do  that  now,  because  it'll  screw  up my  page  and  it'll  actually ask  you  for  this  microscopic  number  back  here, which  is  beneath  the  bar  code. Once  you  do  that,  it'll  link  up and  then  every  time  you  click  on  this  machine, it'll  sink  your  scores  into  canvas  now. Well,  that's  an  oversimplification, but  it'll  sync  it  into  this  little  white  thing  down  here, which  then  I  need  to  sync  into  Canvas. So  every  lecture,  at the  end  of  lecture  I'll  sync  the  scores. And  then  you  can  actually  see  how  your  scores  went  in, in  terms  of  the  actual  buttons. It's  very  basic,  it's  ABCDE. I  will  put  up  stuff  on  the  board  and  then  you will  just  click  A  or  B  or  whatever  you  want  to. And  it  just  feeds  right  in  your  answer  feeds  in. Sometimes  I'll  ask  you  questions  that  are  a  little bit  like  sensitive  and then  I'll  actually  do  an  anonymous  poll, which  means  that  it  doesn't track  your  answer  to  your  name, It  just  goes  in  that  you  answered  something,  okay? Now,  in  terms  of  how  you're  graded, you're  not  actually  graded  on correct  or  incorrect  answers  because most  of  my  questions  don't actually  have  a  correct  or  incorrect  answer. You're  only  graded  on  whether  or  not  you  click. If  you  click  something,  you  get  credit. I  also  know  we're  in  the  middle  of,  well,  not  nowhere, but  we're  on  the  outskirts  of  this  campus  and  I'm guessing  a  lot  of  you  are  going  to either  struggle  to  get  here  or  struggle  to  leave  here. I  always  make  it  so  that  I  forget  what  the  setting  is. It's  either  50%  of  all  the  clicks  or  everything  but  one. If  you  come  a  little  late  and  you  miss  one, don't  stress  is  the  message  there. Yeah.  Any  questions  about  clickers? Yeah,  yeah. Any  version  of  the  clicker, even  the  very  first  one, will  work  in  this  class. Yeah.  Please  check  your  scores  right  away  because if  there's  any  problem  at  all  with a  technical  connection  between  the  two, we  should  fix  it  right  away. But  that's  a  good  question.  Yeah,  Yeah. So  you'll  see  on  the  syllabus  that this  class  doesn't  count  for clickers.  That's  a  good  question. It  starts  next  week. Yeah.  By  next  Tuesday  you  should  bring  one  in. Let's  say  you  bring  it on  on  Tuesday  and  then  you're  like, oh  shit,  I  didn't  register  it. Right.  That's  okay. Because  it  actually  registers your  responses  based  on  the  little  barcode. And  then  eventually  when  you  register  it  links  it  up. The  other  common  question  I  get  is, what  if  I  switched  my  clicker  machine halfway  through  the  class? That  actually  does  sync  up  your  two  scores. But  sometimes  there's  a  glitch  there  where  it thinks  two  different  students  are  participating. You  should  come  and  talk  to  me. If  you  lose  your  clicker  halfway  through  and  buy another  one  or  something  like  this  happens,  okay? I  do  have  to  say  there's  an  academic  integrity  note. I  also  need  to  say,  which is  this  doesn't  really  often  happen, but  let's  say  you  happen  to not  be  able  to  come  to  class and  you  want  your  friend  to  click  in  for  you. That  is  an  academic  integrity  violation. We  did  have  a  student  once  who had  like  five  clickers  on  her  lap, and  unfortunately  she  got  booted out  of  the  class  and  got  an  F  for  the  class, as  did  her  fellow  four  clicker  mates. And  really  just  don't  do  that because  you're  actually  forgiven  some  clicker  points. You're  actually  forgiven  too. You  don't  need  to  take  the  risk, you  can  just  not  show  up  one  time. Yeah.  Any  other  questions? Yeah,  you  need  to  buy  it. Unfortunately,  there  are  no  textbooks  for  this  class. There  are  no  books  for  this  class. Everything  is  digitized  to compensate  for  the  fact that  you  have  to  buy  this  little  thing. They  are  sold  at  the  bookstore, they're  readily  available. They're  also,  I  really  encourage  you  to look  at  the  used  ones  because they're  like  half  the  price  and they're  just  exactly  the  same. Yeah,  just  get  a  disinfectant  white.  Any  other  questions? What  version  do  I  recommend? I  am  very  technologically challenged  and  so  I  don't  know  how  to  answer  that. Does  anybody  else  have  an  answer  to  that  question? Like  is  there  one  that  like  clicks  smoother? I  don't  actually  know.  I'm  sorry. It's  a  really  good  question. Because  it  could  be  like  the  iphone where  there's  a  huge  difference  between  one  or  the  other. Or  maybe  it's  like  the  iphone  and  there's no  huge  difference  between  one  or  the  other. I  don't  actually  know. I  would  say  that  the  basic  one  is  all  you  need. There  are  some  classes  where  you  have  to  like  type  in responses  and  stuff  and  then the  higher  end  ones  apparently  do  that. But  I  don't  need  anything  like  that.  Yeah,  good. Anything  else?  This  room  is  really  spread  out  anyway. Okay.  If  you're  ever raising  your  hand  and  I  don't  see  you just  yelling  or  making noises  because  it  could  be that  I  just  didn't  spot  you  also, my  vision  is  going  okay. The  other  question  that  I  often  get  from first  years  is,  is  section  mandatory? Yes.  You  have  to  go  to  section,  section  is  mandatory. So  your  TAs  will  be explaining  how  you're  going  to  be  graded  in section  and  you  absolutely  do need  to  go  physically  in  person. Yeah,  that  leads  me  to  the  next  one. If  you  have  any  health  emergencies or  any  kind  of  personal  emergencies, this  happens,  this  is  completely  normal. First  of  all,  you  should  not  try  to  hide, like  the  first  thing  you  should  do  is  either  e  mail  me, send  me  a  message  through  Canvas. Let  one  of  your  TA's  know, just  let  somebody  know that  you're  going  through  something. Just  so  that  we  have  an  awareness  of  what's  going  on. There  are  lots  of  solutions that  we  can  come  up  with  together. You  should  not  be  trying  to  scramble  on  your  own,  right? So  definitely  communicate  with  us, even  in  the  extreme  case  where,  for  instance, you're  going  to  be  out  for  weeks, and  weeks  we  can  work  with  your  college  Dean. So  again,  please  don't  hide, Just  let  us  know  what's  going  on. The  worst  feeling  is  when  a  student  is  doing really  well  and  then  they  disappear  and  we're  like, what  happened  to  that  student? Right?  So  just  let  us  know  what's  happening.  Okay. Questions  about  the  class, about  the  requirements,  how you'll  be  graded,  anything  at  all? Yeah.  It's  a  discussion  section. It  begins  discussion  for UCSD  starts  after  the  first  lecture.  That's  the  rule. Whatever  the  first  lecture  is, if  you  have  a  discussion  scheduled the  day  before,  it  doesn't  matter. It  always  starts  after  the  first  lecture. Yeah.  Any  other  questions? Oh,  and  this  is  recorded. I'm  not  sure  how,  but  it  is  being  recorded so  you  can  watch  it  after  you're  not  being  recorded. Just  the  screens  are  being  recorded. Okay,  good.  No  other  questions. Okay,  we'll  go  through  the  clickers. At  the  beginning  of  next  class, you  will  be  required  to  put  in  a  code. The  code  is  always  a  for  my  class,  easy  to  remember. Then  you'll  see  a  USP  welcome  screen  come  up. That's  how  you'll  know  you're  in.  All  right, one  of  the  things  that  I  want  to  emphasize  in this  class  is  that  you  do  have  a  lot  of  readings, because  it's  a  history  class and  history  classes  you  read. However,  reading  is,  I think  what  a  lot  of  students  fear  it  is, which  is  plot  through  page  by  page, hoping  you  understand  each  page, there  are  strategies  you  can  use to  make  the  reading  more  logical, memorable,  Easy  to  digest  for  yourself. There  are  different  strategies that  I  hope  you're  going  to  be  going  through, either  individually,  in  groups, or  with  your  sections. I  put  up  this  slide  not  because  I  want  you  to instantly  memorize  or  even write  down  all  of  these  details, but  rather  because  I  want  you  to understand  that  reading  is  a  process and  a  skill  and  one that  I  hope  you'll  develop  in  this  class. Now,  I  know  a  lot  of  students  also  say  to  me, Professor,  I  already  know  how  to  read, and  of  course  you're  all  literate. I  know  that.  But  literacy  is  very  similar  to  math. Just  because  you  know  how  to  do  one  kind  of  math doesn't  mean  you  know  how  to  do  all  kinds  of  math. There's  no  shame  in  saying  I  don't  know  how to  do  this  specific  kind  of  reading,  right? Because  you're  learning  how  to approach  different  texts  differently. So  I  put  this  slide  up  just  to  note  for  you  and  flag for  you  that  reading  is  one  of the  core  skills  of  this  particular  class. Okay,  well,  let's  get  started  on  the  actual  content, which  is  why  USP  one. Why  do  we  study  the  history of  American  urban  communities? Why  study  this  longer  arc of  history?  What  is  the  purpose? And  I  will  say  that  urban  history, and  in  particular  the  city  itself, matters  for  a  lot  of  different  reasons. And  in  particular,  it  matters  because  the  urban is  connected  to  all  kinds  of  crises  that  we  face  today. For  instance,  the  climate  crisis  is  an  urban  crisis. Social  crises  unfold  in  the  context  of  cities. For  instance,  when  we  hear  about racial  inequality  and  violence,  class  divide, gender  inequality, various  forms  of  structural and  literal  physical  violence. What  we're  talking  about  is a  spatial  context  that matters  and  that  intervenes  in  that  process. Then,  health  crises. As  we  learned  pretty  recently, the  pandemic  is  not  just  something  floating  in  the  air, It's  a  very  concrete  physical  process. And  it  matters  to  think  about  design,  about  cities, about  where  we're  living,  what are  the  spaces  that  we're  moving  through. This  is  true  as  well  for  access  to  health  care. So  this  class  grounds a  lot  of  these  larger  processes  and  issues  in the  context  of  very specific  concrete  neighborhoods  blocks, houses,  streets,  right? Because  those  things  matter. Because  those  things  participate in  some  way  in  creating  and constructing  these  larger  conceptual problems  that  we  think  about. The  first  place  that  I  want  to  start in  terms  of  thinking  about  urban  crises, is  to  think  about  problems  of  the  Anthropocene. Now,  let  me  ask  you  what  this  word  means  actually, before  you  tell  me  what  it  means, turn  to  the  person  next  to  you  and  introduce  yourself. And  it  could  be  the  person  behind  you  if  you  don't have  somebody  right  next  to  you or  the  person  in  front  of  you, and  then  I  want  you  to  tell  them  what  this  word  means. Okay. So  first  of  all,  thank  you  for  all actually  turning  around  and  introducing  yourself. I  want  to  just  quickly note  why  it  is  that  I  do  that  a  lot  in  this  class, which  is  that  a  couple  of  things. First,  it's  nice  to  have  friends  that are  not  directly  from  your  housing  situation. So  I  think  this  is  an  opportunity  to  get  to  know  people. I  would  urge  you  to  move  around the  classroom  over  the  course  of the  quarter  so  you  don't  meet  just  one  person. And  if  you  spot  somebody  that  you'd really  specifically  like  to  get  to  know, you  could  sit  next  to  them. Because  I  guarantee  you  in class  I  will  make  you  talk  to  them. I've  seen  lots  of  friend  groups  develop  out  of  USP  one. And  I've  also  seen  like wonderful  other  kinds  of  relationships develop  out  of  USP  one. And  I  think  that's  a  nice  benefit of  being  in  person  in  a  class. Second,  there  are  plenty  of pedagogical  studies  that  show  that  you  learn  better. When  you  talk  about  what  you're  learning, it'll  sink  in  deeper, you'll  understand  it  better. You'll  also  develop  the  courage  to  ask  the  question that  you  have  to  a  whole  classroom  full  of  180. That  won't  feel  so  daunting when  you've  already  tried  asking  it to  the  person  next  to  you  and  found  out they  don't  know  the  answer  either,  right? So  really  start  getting  used  to  really  taking  me  up  on these  opportunities  when  I  tell  you  to speak  to  your  neighbor  and  I'm  glad  that  you  did. Somebody  tell  me  what  is  the  Anthropocene? Yeah. World.  Excellent. You  want  to  add  to  that?  That's  very  good. The  human  at  the  center of  developing  or  changing  the  planet. Good.  What  else?  Anything  else? I  think  you  basically  nailed  it. It's  interesting  when  I started  asking  about  the  Anthropocene, like  a  few  years  ago,  people  didn't  know, and  by  now  it  seems  to  be  more  commonly  understood. We  are  absolutely  living  in  the  Anthropocene, where  human  agency  determines  and  geology, soil,  atmosphere,  water,  all  life  forms. We're  really  talking  about  humans as  the  central  agent  for  better  or  worse. Now,  just  to  give  you  a  sense  of what  this  means  in  terms  of  thinking  about the  concrete  places  that  we  live.  Is  it  annoying  that? Am  I  cutting  in  and  out  in  the  sound? No.  Okay.  Maybe  it's  just  the  feedback. Let's  see  if  that  works. Oh,  no.  Okay.  I  can't  figure  out. All  right,  in  terms  of  concrete, what  this  means  in  terms  of  the  places  that  we  live. Geologists  actually  estimate  that  we  move roughly  59  billion  tons  of  material  per  year. That  is  like  an  almost  unfathomable  amount of  material  that  we're  moving  through  construction, through  agriculture,  mining,  resurfacing, thinking  about  how  we  move material  to  build  cities  and  to  build  settlements. So  what  this  means  is  it's  not just  land  that  we're  talking  about, but  water  and  air. The  very  basics  of the  elements  that  we  live  with  that  are  being transformed  by  our  decisions about  how  we're  going  to live  and  where  we're  going  to  live. Of  course,  before  the  Anthropocene  is the  Holocene  and  before  that,  the  Paleolithic  period. For  those  of  you  who  are  trying  to  situate  yourself, okay,  let's  get  my  mouse  to  move. Okay.  So  there's  a  geographer named  Seth  Denizen  who  actually writes  about  how  new  urban  soils are  gradually  created  from, and  I'm  just  going  to  read  it  from  him. Trash,  construction  debris, coal  ash,  dredged  sediment,  petro, chemical  contamination,  green  lawns, decomposing  bodies,  and  rock  ballast. In  other  words,  we  are  building cities  from  these  kinds  of  materials. We  are  building  the  ground that  cities  actually  exist  upon. In  other  words,  we  are  transforming  what  nature  is. Just  to  give  you  some  stats  from  the  global  scene, about  one  fifth  of  Manchester  in the  UK  is  actually  artificial  ground. If  we  think  about  this  from  Rome, Rome  has  actually  been  built  up  by about  50  feet  from its  founding  during  the  Roman  Empire,  2000  years  ago. We're  talking  about  a  complete  transformation. And  yes,  cities  are  at  the  center  of  this  story. But  a  lot  of  times  people  think,  well, okay,  that's  just  abroad. Well,  what  is  this?  Tell  me  what  you're  looking  at. Yeah,  it  looks  like  the  start  of  a  housing  project. In  fact,  it  looks  like  Eighth  College,  doesn't  it? It  looks  a  lot  like  a  massive  project. In  fact,  this  should  probably  look  very familiar  to  some  of  you because  this  is  near  the  city  of  Whittier. I'm  guessing  some  of  you  have  actually  contributed  to this  because  this  once  was  Point  Hills  Landfill, the  nation's  largest  municipal  dump. It  actually  closed  in  2013 because  they  needed  an  even  bigger  dump. But  the  landfill  actually  was  open  from  1957  until  2013. During  that  time  period, it  was  an  enormous  site that  provided  an  area  roughly  the  size of  Central  Park  in  New  York  City to  receive  one  third  of  LA  County's  trash. Are  we  remaking  the  landscape? Absolutely.  The  trash  that's being  generated  to  fill  this  landfill, it's  coming  from  cities. The  landfill  itself  is  becoming  part  of  a  city. There's  all  kinds  of  ways  in  which understanding  cities  means  understanding  waste and  understanding  our  role  in building  a  very  particular  kind  of  new  urbanism. Now,  it's  hard  to imagine  what  this  means  in  concrete  terms. Let  me  give  you  some  examples. If  Quinta  Hills  was  a  place  where  you  buried  elephants, its  tonnage  would  represent about  15  million  dead  pacaderms. Equivalent  to  roughly  every living  elephant  on  Earth  today, times  20  if  it  were  a  place  to  bury. If  it  were  an  automobile  burial  ground, it  could  hold  every  car  that  this  country had  ever  produced  for  the  past  15  years. That's  the  site  of  this  one  municipal  dump. To  give  you  a  sense  of  just  the  scale of  what  we're  talking  about  here, we  are  literally  building  mountains. Okay,  what  else  does  it  mean  to  live  in  the  Anthropocene? Yes,  it  means  that  cities  are  being  built  with  landfill. It  also  means  that  the  cities that  are  being  built  have  to deal  with  the  consequences of  the  kind  of  waste  that  is  being  produced. Whether  that  waste  be  on  the  ground  or  of  course, in  this  case,  in  the  air. We're  going  to  talk  a  lot about  atmosphere,  air  pollution, the  effects  of  air  pollution  on  cities, and  how  to  mitigate  some  of those  consequences  in  the  future. Now  the  temptation  is  to  think, oh,  well  that's  all  a  21st  century  problem. That's  what  we  did  recently,  et  up  recently. But,  you  know,  this  isn't  sort  of the  perennial  problem  with  cities  in  general. So,  I  show  you  this  picture. Do  any  of  you  know  what  city  you're  looking at,  take  a  guess. It's  really  great  to  be  wrong  in  here. Be  bold  about  being  wrong. Yes.  San  Francisco. Any  other  guesses?  Yes. New  York.  Any  other  guesses? San  Diego.  That's  a  good  guess. Yeah,  because  you're  right  that  I tend  to  choose  local  examples. Any  other  guesses?  Okay,  this is  actually  Manhattan  in  New  York  City. But  I  like  that  you  tried out  San  Francisco  and  San  Diego. And  the  reason  why  I  like  that  is  because  most  people don't  realize  Manhattan  was  once  a  hilly  place. A  hilly  place,  It's  not, now  it's  pretty  flat, but  it  once  looked  like  this  and  it  was  actually  called Manhattan  because  it's  from  the  Lenape  word  manhatta, which  means  the  island  of  hills. If  you  think  about  some  of the  history  of  our  oldest  cities, you  can  see  in  fact  that  there  was  what  historians  call  a great  leveling  or  what  you  might  call  a  great  smoothing. About  two  thirds  of all  the  blocks  changes  of  up  to  ten  feet. 40%  of  the  blocks  had elevation  changes  of  up  to  five  feet. So  what  this  means  is  that  over  time, cities  have  brought  down  the  dirt or  raised  the  dirt  to  create  flat  cities. This  is  not  the  way  that  cities originally  were  settled  in  the  United  States. Valleys  were  filled  in,  hills  were  lowered,  right? And  in  fact,  overall  elevation  increased  in  the  case of  Manhatta  by  1.75  feet. There's  a  lot  of  change  that  we  can  track  over these  really  large  periods  of  time  that help  us  to  understand  how  cities function  and  how  powerful  the  human  role  has  been  in, not  just  for  the  20th  century when  we  talk  about  the  anthropocy, not  for  the  21st  century  only, but  all  the  way  back  into  the  1700s  and  the  1800s, we're  talking  about  processes  that  have taken  centuries  to  unfold. This  is  not  just  for  land, it's  also  true  for  water. This  is  actually  the  Chicago  River. What  you're  looking  at  is  a  Chicago  River that  humans  decided  to  reverse  the  direction  of. The  reason  why  they  reverse  the  direction  was because  wanted  the  waste  to flow  downstream  instead  of  upstream. In  18,  92,  19th  century  history  we're  talking  about, the  residents  of  Chicago  decided to  transform  water  in  this  really  powerful  way. The  consequences  of  this  are  enormous. We'll  talk  more  about  Chicago when  we  get  to  that  time  period. We  can  also  think  about  it  more locally.  Have  any  of  you  been  here? This  is  a  really  amazing, intense  site  to  visit  and  you  will  leave  this  site, I  think  being  impressed. What  are  we  looking  at  here? Yes,  yes. This  is  the  Hoover  Dam, built  1931-35  This  is  a Depression  Era  project. It  generates  on  average, 4  billion  kilowatt  hours  of hydroelectric  power  each  year. And  that  power  is  used  by  a  lot  of different  cities  across  Nevada,  Arizona,  and  California. Now,  it's  not  only  a  source  of  energy, but  it's  also,  of  course,  a  source  of  irrigation. Today,  the  dam  irrigates  about  1  million  acres  in the  US  and  half  1  million  acres  in  Mexico. A  lot  of  people  don't  understand  that the  Colorado  system  river  system  is  not  a  national  one. Rivers  don't  realize  when  national  boundaries  change. So  this  is  a  US,  Mexico  project. And  in  fact,  for  those  of you  who  don't  care  about  the  Southwest, you're  like,  oh  well  too  bad,  you  know, I'm  going  to  go  and  live  my  sweet  life  in  New  York. I'll  tell  you  that  most  of  the  fruit and  vegetables  that  people  eat  across  the  nation, and  indeed  across  the  world, are  coming  out  of  crops  that  are  grown  with  this  water. So  these  are  global  impacts,  global  connections. And  they  are  imbricated  in  the  kinds  of water  demands  of  cities  and  suburbs  across  the  Southwest. Okay.  So  these  huge  water  systems, a  lot  of  times  people  think  well  water  has nothing  to  do  with  wildfire,  but  it  actually  does. We're  going  to  talk  a  lot  more  about the  connections  between  fire and  water  when  we  get  to  the  section  on  wildfires. But  suffices  to  say, when  you  change  the  water  system, you  change  the  plants. In  this  case,  what  you're  doing  is  moving from  fire  resistant  scrub  and  sage, to  thinking  more  about  fast  burning  non  native  plants  and dry  these  very  like flammable  ingredients  in  addition  to  our  suburbs, which  are  of  course  highly  flammable, the  suppression  of  fires  that would  naturally  occur  in  conjunction  with the  transformation  of  the  actual  landscape are  causing  a  great  deal  of vulnerability  in  our  cities  and  suburbs to  this  increasingly  devastating  occurrence  of  fire. At  the  same  time,  urbanization continues  apace  people  continue  to move  to  cities  at  a  pace  that we  have  not  seen  prior  to  1945, which  is  why  we  call  the  20th  century and  the  21st  century, basically  the  urban  century, we're  talking  about  a  profound  set of  changes  in  the  environment, in  human  society,  in  the  world  itself. Based  on  this  movement, the  cities  that  we  do  have  are  not  only growing  in  terms  of  the  number  of  people  living  in  them, but  they're  growing  in  terms  of the  landmass  and  in  terms  of the  urban  crises  that  follow  them.  Tell  me  something. When  did  the  world  become  majority  urban? Give  me  a  date.  Holer  it. 1922.  Good  guess. Anybody  want  to  up  that  number  or  lower  that  number? When  did  the  world  become  urban? The  majority  of  the  world  citizens  living  in  cities. Yeah.  Late  1,800  Any  other  guesses? Yes.  1980s.  Any  other  guesses? Yeah,  2005. Okay,  You  placed  your  bets. It  is  actually  2007  that  the  UN estimates  that  the  majority  of  people  moved  to  cities. Now,  this  is  a  little  bit  funky, I'll  be  honest  with  you,  because  it depends  on  how  you  define  what  a  city  is,  right? Like  if  you  say  a  city  collection  of  500  people, then  you  might  have  a  different  date than  if  you  say  it's  1  million  plus. So  again,  the  stats  are  a  little  bit  variable, but  this  is  the  kind  of  data  being  put  out right  now  about  the  urbanization  of  the  world. One  thing  that  we  can  say  for  sure is  that  the  moment  when  the  majority  of people  start  flooding  into  cities and  becoming  part  of  this  urban  population, or  this  movement  to  higher  density  living is  roughly  right  after  World  War  Two. And  there  are  a  lot  of  historical  reasons why  people  don't  move to  cities  and  mass  until  after  World  War  two. Okay.  What  about  the  US? When  does  the  US  become  a  majority  urban  nation? I'm  going  to  go  back  to  student  over  here. What  date  did  you  give  again? 1923.  You  were  very  close. For  the  US,  the  majority  moves  in  1920. And  the  reason  why  it's  a  solid 2022  or  23  is  because  it's  done  by  the  census, which  is  every  ten  years,  1920 is  when  the  US  becomes  a  majority  urban. But  remember  how  I  said  it's  funky because  it  depends  how  you  define  cities. A  city  by  the  census  at that  time  was  defined  as  2,500  or  more. So  that's  pretty  small,  right? The  US.  Becomes  majority  urban  in  1920, the  world  in  the  past  two  decades. We're  talking  about  a  phenomenon  where  I  think it's  very  useful  to  look  at  what  happened  in  the  US, because  what  we're  tracking  is a  set  of  patterns  about  how Economic  systems  play  out  in  a  spatial  way  in  the  US. In  a  way  that  is  in  some  ways  connected  to what  we're  seeing  happening  in  the  21st  century. For  other  places  that  are  urbanizing  now, it's  not  always  true,  it's  not  always  prescriptive, but  there  are  really  interesting  connections. Okay,  back  to  the  main  question. Why  does  the  city  matter?  Why  do  we  study  cities? Why  don't  we  just  study  the  world,  right? Why  don't  we  study  urban  and  rural, and  agricultural,  and  everything  all  mixed  together? Well,  I  will  say  that  urban  matters because  when  we  look  at  high  density  development, we're  also  thinking  about  problems  of governance.  What  do  I  mean  by  that? We're  thinking  about  questions  of whether  or  not  governance  happens at  a  scale  that  adequately  deals with  the  political  needs  of  the  people  living  there. Now,  in  the  case  of  city  governments, a  recent  movement  that  has started  is  this  specific  one  addressing the  question  of  whether  or  not  nation  states  are inadequate  to  fully  represent  the  needs  of  people. Is  it  perhaps  the  moment  where  we're  looking  at city  governments  rising  to  fill  this  need? Somebody  read  this  first one  out  loud  for  the  whole  class, the  challenge  of  democracy  in  the  modern  world, joint  participation,  which  is  local. Thank  you.  Somebody  read  the  next excellent,  and  somebody  bring  in  the  last. Excellent,  Thank  you.  This  is  a  quote  by  Benjamin  Barber. Turn  to  the  person  next  to  you  and put  this  into  normal  English. Okay,  Some  of  just  stumped, while  some  of  you  like  kind  of  went  right  in. What  does  that  mean?  Is  on  the  super  hard, this  will  be  a  lot  easier  when  we  have  clickers. Okay.  Three  super  hard. One  super  easy.  Hold  up  your  fingers.  Let  me  just  see. It's  a  vision  test  for  me  too. Just  hold  up  your  fingers.  Oh,  good. Average  looks  like  for  most  of  you. Okay.  Some  of  the  twos. Tell  me  what  you  picked  out  of  here. It's  okay  if  you  don't  get  it  all,  it's  okay. Even  if  you  got  it  wrong,  just  start picking  out  what  you  understood. Yeah.  It's  hard  to the  whole  country  join  together  a  the  other  places which  in  a  small  city  you're more  willing  to  listen to  the  Mayor  because  they  they  live  in. That that's very  good.  That's  excellent. Did  the  two  of  you  figure  that's  excellent?  Very  good. And  I'm  also  blown  away  by  the  fact  that  we  can all  track  your  words  here  in  case  we  can't  hear  you. This  is  also  an  excellent  room.  Good  job  room. Okay,  anybody  else  want  to  say something  that  was  right  on? Anything  else  that  you  notice? What  is  cosmopolitanism?  Somebody  take  the  bottom, which  is  the  more  like  bulky, physically  bulk  part. What  is  cosmopolitanism? Turn  to  the  person  next  to  you  and tell  them  what  is  cosmopolitim. Turn  to  the  person  next  to  you,  Try. Okay.  Good.  I  feel  like  you're  getting  it. Tell  me  what  is  cosmopolitanism? Somebody  on  this  side  here, you're  in  the  splash  zone. If  you're  in  the  front,  can  I  just  call  on  you? If  you're  in  the  How  about  in  the  future? Not  today.  If  you  sit  in  the  front  two  rows, you're  in  the  splash  zone  and  I'll  call  on  you.  Okay. Okay.  Not  today  though  because  you  didn't  have any  warning  somebody  on  this  side. What  is  cosmopolitanism? Y. It  is  absolutely trying  to  equalize  power. That's  very  good.  And  what  is  the  relationship  between individuals  and  nation  in  that  cosmopolitanism? Let's  go  to  the  middle  now. Somewhere  in  the  middle, Yes,  absolutely. Every  individual  is  considered  an autonomous  political  unit,  right? It  doesn't  matter  if  you're  tall or  short,  whatever,  right? Male,  female,  etcetera.  Yeah,  good. What  is  the  relationship  between those  autonomous  individuals  and the  state  or  the  nation  here? We're  not  talking  about  like  California,  Nevada, We're  talking  about  state  as  being like  government  sort  of  broadly. Okay.  What  is  the  relationship between  that  kind  of  grassroots power  movement  and  states? I  like  how  everyone's  avoiding eye  contact  except  you  can  I  call  on  you? Is  that  okay?  Uh  huh. Okay. Great  citizens  to, for  example,  officials  power. Yeah.  So,  the  state  does  have  this  top  down  authority, whether  it  be  through  policing  or  through  other  forms of  top  down  authority,  right? And  then  you  have  these  individuals  pushing back  from  grassroots  up  movement,  right? So  this  tension  between  the  two  in that  really  tense  relationship,  often  tense  relationship. What  do  you  see  as  being  the  role  of  cosmopolitanism? What  is  he  saying  about  cosmopolitanism? Look  at  the  text  really  closely. Let's  look  again  here. Cosmopolitanism  responds  by  imagining citizens.  Let's  skip  all  of  that. Reaching  across  frontiers  to confront  and  contain  central  power. Here  Barbara  is  saying, cosmopolitanism  is  a  web  or  a  network  of grass  roots  power  based  movements that  are  then  reaching  up  and  controlling, or  confronting,  or  containing these  top  down  larger  state  powers. And  this  is  a  really  interesting  moment to  think  about  how  this  is  playing  out  in  our  cities. In  other  words,  here  in  the  beginning, you  have  exactly  what  you  said  before, which  is  you  have  the  power  of  the  local,  right? The  power  of  the  city. And  then  you  have  cosmopolitanism. These  networks  between  these  local  actors really  reaching  up  and  controlling, confronting,  containing  state  power. This  is  a  question  of  governance. And  the  central  stage  on  which  this  fight  is  being fought  is  in  cities is  in  these  dense  human  settlements,  right? So  let's  think  a  little  bit  about  more  what  this  means. This,  by  the  way,  is  called  the  Municipalist  moment, The  Municipalist  movement,  right? They  have  a  lot  of  different  names for  what  we're  describing  here  as  the  city, as  a  source  of  political  re,  organization. I  can  point  to  different  ways  in  which you  see  this  tension  playing  out. For  instance,  you  see the  tension  between  the  federal  and  the local  playing  out  specifically in  the  withdrawal  from  the  Paris  agreement. I  try  to  choose  older  examples, so  we  have  a  little  bit  of  distance. So  that's  why  I'm  not  choosing something  straight  out  of  a  newspaper. The  US  withdraws  from  the  Paris  Agreement. This  is  a  federal  decision,  right? Top  down  decision. And  then  you  have  cities  pushing  back  against  that, with  the  Council  of  Mayors  saying  we  are  still in  declaring  we  are still  following  the  Paris  Agreement  principles. This  is  a  classic  example  of exactly  this  tension  that  we're  seeing unfolding  over  questions  of  governance. It  is  playing  out  in  the  US, it  is  playing  out  internationally. And  again,  it  is  labeled broadly  as  this  municipalist  moment. So  why  do  we  study  cities? Why  do  we  consider  cities? Because,  yes,  it  is wrapped  up  in  questions  of  the  anthropos, questions  of  environmental  crisis. And  also  yes,  because  cities  are  at the  center  of  the  crisis  over governance  that  we  are  facing, both  within  the  United  States  and  globally. Third  reason  why  we  study  cities, problems  of  racism,  problems  of  conflict. Racism,  race  conflict,  racial  authority, all  of  the  sort  of  ways  in  which  we  see  conflict  over questions  of  race  and  ethnicity playing  out  happen  in  real  space. Now  we  often  lose  sight  of  that, I  think  because  we're  focused  on particular  political  positions  that  we've  embraced. But  the  space  matters. So  I  think  in  this  class  we  need  to  reinsert  that. It  isn't  just  a  backdrop. If  you  think  a  little  bit  about where  these  things  are  happening, if  you  look  at  the  design  of the  places  where  these  things  are  happening, it  actually  matters  for  thinking  about  power, for  thinking  about  the  negotiation  of  that  power. This  is  part  of  a  movement  called  Black  space. I  encourage  you  to  look  at  it  if  you're  curious  about  it. We're  definitely  going  to  go  through some  of  this  more  in  some  of our  later  lectures.  Okay. It  matters  also  in  terms  of  thinking  about  violence. Street  level  violence  side of  a  transportation  network  of  violence. There  are  all  kinds  of  ways  in  which  we can  think  about  urban  design playing  a  role  and  thinking about  how  conflict  unfolds  in  cities. Okay,  I'm  going  to  leave  that  there  for  now, but  we  are  going  to  return  to  that when  we  get  to  a  later  lecture. Again,  let's  repeat,  why  do  cities  matter? Anthropocene  thinking  about  governance, thinking  about  some  of  our  most  acute  crises over  racial  conflict. Are  there  connections  between urban  spaces,  racism,  and  design? These  are  questions  that  we're  going  to  be  interrogating. For  instance,  what  are  the  connections between  segregation  and  violence? What  about  where  we  live  versus  where  we  work? Let  me  look  at the  time  and  see  if  we  don't  have  time  to  discuss, but  these  are  some  of  the  ways  in  which  we're  going to  start  to  think  about  how  space  intervenes. Cities  help  us  see  the  tension  between publicly  owned  space  and  publicly  used  space. So  here  we're  getting  into  some  of the  ten  year  stuff  that  I'm  interested  in, which  is  who  owns  a  space,  really? What  does  it  mean  to  own  space? Right?  What  does  it  mean  to  occupy  space  here? I  will  actually  have  you  try this  out  with  somebody  sitting  next  to  you. Describe  a  public  space  not  owned  by  an  individual, not  owned  by  Westfield  Malls not  owned  by  any  particular  corporation. Describe  a  public  space  where  you  feel  you belong  and  a  public  space  where you  feel  you  do  not  belong.  Try  that  out. Okay.  Let's  hear. A  public  space  where  you  feel  you  belong. Yeah.  The  beach.  Very  good. The  beach  places  where  you  feel  you  belong. Yep.  Parks  and  hiking  trails. That  is  a  place  that  you  belong. Okay.  Good.  Where  else  do  you  feel  you  belong? Public  spaces.  Do  you  feel  you  belong  in  this  classroom? That's  a  public  the  State  of  California  owns  the  space. Yeah.  Good  public  libraries. Okay.  Other  public  spaces  you  feel  you  belong, do  you  feel  you  belong  on  streets? Those  are  public  spaces. Okay.  Let's  lean  into  the  next  section. Public  places  where  you  feel  you  do  not  belong? Yes.  Oh,  sorry.  Did  somebody  say  something? I  missed  it.  Dog  barks?  Yes. Very  good.  No  dog,  no  welcome. Yeah.  Okay.  Where  else? Yeah.  And  it's  ugly. Double  whammy?  Yeah.  Good. Other  places  you  feel  you  do  not  belong? Yeah.  Oh,  who  does  belong  there?  Anybody? Okay,  good.  Now  we're  getting  into the  uncomfortable  zones.  Okay,  good. Now  you're  going  there  other  places you  feel  you  do  not  belong. Some  of  this  is  hard  to  say,  right? Because  it  has  to  do  with  racial  identity. Class  identity  has  to  do  with  all  kinds of  ways  in  which  you  feel  you  fit  or  don't  fit. In  certain  places,  yeah. Okay.  Places  where  you  feel  you  don't  belong. A  park  with  homeless  people. Can  you  explain  why  you  feel  you  don't  belong  there? Yeah.  So  do  you  feel  like  it's  a  private  space? Is  that  why  and  then  you're  entering  into  it? Yeah,  it  makes  you  uncomfortable. Okay,  Yes.  Gang  territory. Gang  territory.  You  feel you  don't  belong  like  a  street  that  is clearly  part  of  a  particular  gang  affiliation. Okay.  You  had  your  hand  raised. Very  affluent  neighborhoods. I  like  how  your  not  going  to  name  a  specific,  you  know, La  Joya  always  comes  up  in  this  class  room. Alright.  Alright,  good. So,  really  affluent  neighborhoods might  make  you  feel  uncomfortable. Good. Yes. A,  Mm. So  people  who  are  doing  things  that are  unfi,  separate  from  your  life. Okay.  Good.  Yes.  The  nude  beach? Yes.  No  comment  necessary? Yes.  The  flowers  reject  you?  Yeah. That's  okay.  Very  good. Allergies?  Yeah.  Way  in  the  back, public  restrooms  at  gas  stations. I  haven't  heard  that  one  before, but  that's  a  good  one.  Any  others? Yeah.  Underground  parking  structures is  like  an  unsafe  feeling  for  you?  Mm  hmm. Okay.  Good.  Yeah.  Design.  Uh  huh. So  basically  all  of  California. Yeah.  Okay.  Let  me  ask  you  though, shouldn't  feel  comfortable,  Isn't  it  that  public  space? Isn't  it  owned  by  the  public? I  mean,  you're  part  of  the  public,  right? So  why  is  it  that  in  a  space  that  you  are  part  owner  to? This  was  designed  for  you  as  part  of  the  public. Why  do  you  not  belong? Is  that  truly  a  public  space? Who  was  speaking?  Sorry.  Yes. Great. Wanted  to  wise. That's  a  great  comment. We  can't  satisfy  all have  to  make  decisions  about  whether. Okay,  comment  over  there a  I  don't  way. Right?  Like  what  are  the  rules  of the  space  and  are  you  following  the  rules  of  that  space? Yeah,  that's  a  really  great  comment  and  an  example. Yeah,  I  think  it  matters how  much  we  like  takes  care  of  the  space, like  how  well  the  taking  care  of  example, like  a  public  bathroom. Some  bathrooms  are  nasty, some  are  actually  taking  pretty  good  care  of  that. Definitely  as  that  is a  good  comment  and  slides  into my  next  comment  for  you  or  question  for  you, which  is,  do  you  feel like  you  need  to  maintain  the  public  space? Like  when  you  see  like  a really  dirty  space  and  you're  like, well,  this  I  feel  uncomfortable  here. Do  you  feel  like  you  should  jump  in  and maintain  your  part  of  the  public,  it's  your  public  space. I  think  the  expectation  should  be, don't  make  it  any  worse  than  it  was  before. So  definitely  about  yourself. Yes,  I  do  think  there  should  be some  expectation  that  if  it's  easy  to  do  so and  you're  able  to  make  public  space  better.  Okay. Good.  So  you  see  that  filthy  bathroom? Clean  it?  No,  I'm  joking. Sorry,  I  joke  a  lot.  Sometimes  inappropriately. Okay.  Yes.  Sometimes  you  feel  like  you  belong sometimes  bottle  internally  with question  if  humans  belong  in  nature  because encroach  on  others  and  we  also  like  wipe  the  met  or pollute  like  their  habitat  that's  there. Sometimes  I  feel  like  this  is  a  public  space, but  I  should  step  in  there. Sources,  right? That's  actually  great  because  what  you're  saying  is, who  actually  is  the  public,  right? Does  it  include  non  human  actors? And  you're  saying  it  should, but  in  the  accounting  for  this  space,  it  didn't. Right?  That's  a  great  comment. Yeah.  A  lot  of  people  also  have inclination  to  make  a  change  to  public  spaces, but  it's  like  whether  you  actually  do  so. Like  for  the  homeless  example, I  think  everyone  would  look  at  it  and  be  like, oh,  I'm  going  to  make  a  change  to  this  public  space. But  it's  like,  are  you  actually  going  to  like, what  are  the  steps  that  you're going  to  take  to  make  a  difference? So  the  difference  between  kind  of high  thinking  and  then  the  difficulties  of  action. That  is  very  good.  I  keep  doing  what  I  told  myself. I  wouldn't  do  it  just  to  comment on  your  comments.  So  I'll  be  quiet. Anybody  else  want  to  say  something? Yeah, yeah, these  are  amazing  comments  and I  like  them  because  you're  really  taking apart  these  definitions  that  we use  in  planning  and  in  urban  design. Kind  of  unthinkingly  to  some  degree,  right? Oh,  this  is  a  public  space,  this  is  a  private  space. And  we  just  assume  we  know  what  those  things  mean,  right? But  we  don't  account  for  them  over  time  periods. We  don't  account  for  them  according  to  the  rules of  that  space  and  who's  following  or  not  following  them. We  don't  think  about  who  the  public is  in  terms  of  non  human  actors. Like  there's  all  these  complicated  ways in  which  we  can  start  thinking  about  what  it means  to  really  look at  the  terms  that  we're  using.  What  is  public? What  is  public  ownership?  What  is  public  use? Right?  And  so  I  really  like the  way  that  you're  picking  these  apart. I  also  want  to  say,  by  the  way, you  can  say  stuff  in  this  lecture  hall that  I  absolutely  hate. And  that's  fine.  Like  there's no  reason  why  I  should  like  every  comment  you  make. So  we  should  start  to  make  this  a  space where  it's  comfortable  to  disagree  with  each  other. Like  I  hope  by  the  end  of  this  lecture, not  this  specific  lecture, but  the  end  of  this  term, you  will  feel  comfortable  being  like, hey  you  John  in  the  back. I  hated  what  you  said, and  let  me  tell  you  why.  This  is  why. And  then  John  can  respond,  hey, you  know,  Jane,  this  is  why  you're  actually  wrong. You  know,  this  kind  of  debate is  healthy  and  this  is  what  we  should  be  saying. And  I  can  jump  in  and  be  like, you're  both  wrong  and  let  me  tell  you  why. Right,  um,  the  wrong  or  the  right  is  not  the  key  point. The  key  point  is  the  tools  that  we're developing  to  dissect  and  look  at  space  together. Okay?  All  right, so  let's  talk  a little  bit  about  the  tools that  we're  going  to  be  working  on. One  of  the  things  that  we're  going  to  be focusing  on  in  this  class  is  vision. How  you  see  things,  right, the  way  you  see  things  is  actually  going to  inform  the  policies  that  you  write. Now,  a  lot  of  times,  the  way  you  look  at something  I  wanted  to  say, invisible  to  you  is  not  conscious  to  you. It's  not  in  the  forefront  of  your  mind. You're  like,  oh,  I'm  looking  at  this building  with  this  kind  of  eyes. Like  you  don't  really  do  that, you  just  look  at  the  building,  right? But  in  fact,  to  bring  that  into  a  state  of consciousness  and  to  think  a  little  bit  more about  how  we  visualize  space. Because  how  we  visualize  is  going  to  be  absolutely foundational  to  thinking  about the  kinds  of  designs  we  come  up  with  for  the  future. So  think  a  little  bit  about  how you  visualize  a  city  that  you  live  in. How  you  visualize  San  Diego. You're  all  living  in  San  Diego right  now  to  some  degree,  right? How  do  you  visualize  the  space? Do  you  primarily  visualize  it  as  A,  B,  C,  or  D? And  then  think  a  little  bit  about the  way  that  you  visualize the  space  in  your  mind  is  going to  change  the  way  you  think  about  how  you  want  to change  or  interact  with  or  shape  that  space. So  let  me  repeat  that.  Think  about  which  of  these four  best  captures  how  you  imagine  San  Diego. Or  it  could  be  that  you  don't  imagine  San  Diego. How  you  imagine  one  neighborhood, or  one  cluster,  or  one  dormitory  space. How  do  you  imagine  that  space  that  you  live  in? How  do  you  think  the  way  that you're  imagining  it  is  going  to change  what  you  prescribe or  try  to  change  about  this  place  in  the  future. Okay.  Think  about  that  for  a  second, then  tell  me  what  you  think. Well,  first,  raise  your  hand. How  many  of  you  visualize a  when  you're  thinking  about  where  you  live? You're  like,  I'm  a  map  person. I  do  my  Google  Earth  and  that's  how I  imagine  it.  Okay,  How  about  B? Put  it  so  I  can  see it's  smaller  but  still  fair  sprinkling. Interesting.  Okay,  Conceptual. Yeah,  I'm  a  conceptual  person.  D  is  me. Like  I  come  up  with  blobs  and think  about  how  the  blobs  relate  to  each  other. I'm  like,  that's  where  I  go  shopping, that's  where  I  lay  down  and  rest. If  you  think  about  the  way  that  you  visualize, how  is  it  that  these  have different  prescriptions  for  the  future? Yeah,  what  you  want, your,  how  you're  thinking about  it  influences  like  what  you  actually  want  for  it. So  like  if  you  visualize, you  might  want  to  like  towards  that. You  focus  on  where  things  are  de  hoping  a  developed, you  just  want  things  that  go like  focuses  on  You're  focused on  hoping  you're  focused  on  want  Sano. Yeah.  Relatable  comment.  Yeah,  very  good. We're  really  talking  about  scale  here,  right? We're  talking  about  scale  and  how  you sort  of  move  towards  an  ideal. So  I  think  that's  a  really, that's  a  very  precise  kind of  response  to  thinking  about  that. And  let's  look  at  it  in the  case  of  this  specific  blobby  one, because  I  kind  of  anticipated that  most  of  you  wouldn't  choose  this  one. So  for  those  of  you  who  chose  it, you're  one  of  the  rare  ones that  are  going  to  be  focused  on. This  is  actually  a  pretty  famous  picture. It's  from  a  guy  named  Kevin  Lynch. I  don't  know  if  you  recognize  the  name, we'll  talk  about  him  more  later. Architect,  and  he  does  this  particular  schematic  to show  how  planners  might  think about  how  an  everyday  resident  interacts  with  a  city. So  they  don't  look  at  a  city  and  think,  okay, these  are  the  ten  blocks  and  these  are  the  ten  streets. And  this  is  usually,  he  argues, that  people  have  sort  of  a  conceptual  roadmap for  thinking  about  the  relationship  between  spaces. And  then  in  the  spaces where  they  don't  really  understand  or  they  don't  know, it  becomes  more  and  more  blobby,  right? Because  you  don't  actually  really  understand  the  space. So  kind  of  vaguely  you're  like, oh  that's  where  the  rich  people  are. That's  like  you  don't  have a  very  precise  kind  of  geography  of  that  space. He  says  this  is  the  way  that  planners  think. I  think  arguably, this  is  also  the  way  that  planners  think, which  is  to  say  that planners  tend  to  take  a  bird's  eye  point  of  view. They  tend  to  float  above the  city  and  look  down  on  it,  right? Say,  where  are  Asians  living? Yeah,  You  know,  I'm  joking  okay. But,  you  know,  you  sort  of  see  this  kind  of like  bird  like  position  kind  of  floating  above  the  city, mapping  different  areas  of  that  city. You  could  also  say  that  sometimes they  take  this  kind  of  horizon type  view  of  the  way  that  a  city  is  organized. And  here  you're  looking  at  buildings, sort  of  as  a  schematic  from  the  ground  level. However,  what  would  happen  or  what  would change  if  you  looked  at the  city  from  a  different  point  of  view? Would  you  want  to  live  in  the  city?  Why? Yes  or  no?  Yes,  I  would  like  to  live  in  the  city. It's  really  hard  to  persuade Californians  to  like  high  rises,  but  okay. No,  I  don't  want  to  live  in  the  city. Oh,  most  of  you  did  not. Not  sure  what's  involved. I  need  to  know  more.  All  right. What  is  different  about this  point  of  view  versus  this  point  of  view? Yeasts, it's  weird,  right? It  looks  more  monotonous from  the  ground  than  it  does  from  the  sky. Which  is  surprising.  Yeah.  What  else  do  you  notice in  terms  of  the  difference  of  living in  these  two  different  worlds? Yeah.  Yeah,  absolutely. Would  you  want  to  walk  down  the  street? No.  Why  not? Yeah, yeah,  yeah. I  mean,  I  I'm  going  to  get  mugged  in  that  lower  picture. Like  I'm  going  to  be  really  in trouble  if  somebody  jumps  out  and  is  like, Boo,  give  me  your  wallet. I'll  be  like,  here  you  go,  you  know, 'cause  I  don't  really  see  where  to  go. So  I  think  that  when  we  talk  about  seeing, and  when  we  talk  about  orderly  cities, organized  cities,  pretty  cities. These  are  all  subjective  words  that  we're  using,  right? But  they're  absolutely  critical  to thinking  about  what  we're  going  to  design  for  the  future. I  think  it's  important  to  think about  what  viewpoint  we're  embracing. And  when  we  design  these  kind  of  spaces,  of  course, people  use  schematics  all  the time  to  decide  where  to  live  and  how  to  live. This  is  another  kind  of  schematic  that  is  used  a  lot. What  does  this  map  tell  you? Best  schools  in  San  Diego. Good.  We're  way  up  here,  by  the  way, on  this  little  area  right  here,  we  are  not  part  of  this. This  is  elementary  and  middle  and  high  school. Obviously,  UCSD  is  not  part  of  it. What  else  do  you  notice  here? Yeah.  Yeah.  Good.  Can  you  say  it  one  more  time? Really  loud  according  to  this  particular  map. Right.  So  people  can  actually  track real  estate  values  based  on  a  school  map,  right? You  can  also  track  race based  on  these  school  maps,  right? Why  would  people  choose  to  live  in a  neighborhood  they  have not  looked  at  or  experienced  at  this  level? They  do  it  because  in  their  minds, they're  running  off  of  this  map. This  is  how  they're  visualizing  the  city. By  the  way,  for  those  of  you  who  are  like, oh  my  god,  the  school  I  went  to  is  in  the  red  zone. I  live  in  the  red  zone  and  I  send my  children  to  the  red  zone.  Welcome. But  this  is  the  way  in which  people  visualize  space,  right? It's  really  powerful  to  think  about  the  way  that  we map  in  our  heads  informs  our  everyday  decisions. It  corresponds,  like  I  said, to  racial  maps  as  well. This  is  a  racial  dot  map. For  those  of  you  who  don't  know, racial  dot  maps  will  talk  a  lot  more about  racial  dot  maps  in  the  future. Okay,  So  how  you  map  a  city, you  look  at  a  city, how  you  map  a  city  reveals  your  beliefs, your  identity,  your  central  organizing  principles. And  then  this  one  I  haven't  talked  about  yet  as  much, but  it  also  talks  about  how  you perceive  built  form  versus  movement. A  lot  of  times  we  just  map  buildings,  right? But  actually,  wouldn't  it  be  more helpful  to  know  movement? Like  if  you  had  a  UCSD  movement  map, wouldn't  that  be  more  helpful? You're  like,  I  kind  of  want  to  have lunch  where  other  people  are. Like,  it  doesn't  help  to  look  at a  map  where  different  buildings  are. That  doesn't  give  you  the  information  you  need,  right? Or  me  walking  to  this  building  this  morning, it  would  have  been  nice  to  know  that  I couldn't  move  through  all  the  construction  sites, all  of  this  way  in  which  we can  embed  or  encode  different  kinds  of information  to  help  make  us  more aware  of  the  process  by  which  we  move  through  space, less  visible  but  also  present  how  we  map a  city  has  this  incredible  generative  energy. It  gives  us  the  possibility seeing  the  city  differently  and then  making  the  city  different. Okay,  why  study  US  urban  history? First  reason,  gives  us  insight into  how  we  look  at  communities. Second  reason,  because  it  helps us  think  more  effectively  about  movement  across  time. Looking  at  big  change, not  just  a  static  problem  in  a  static  city. I  know  the  temptation  is  to  dig no  deeper  than  ten  years  for  your  datasets. History  is  the  biggest  dataset you're  ever  going  to  come  across. It's  the  dataset  of  all  human  life,  right? Why  not  explore  some  of that  data  to  see  what  lessons  we  can  extract, what  larger  patterns  we  can  detect. It  also  gives  us  some  insight  into  what  assumptions we  bring  to  the  table  when  we  talk about  good  cities  and  bad  cities. I  can't  tell  you  how  many  times people  have  told  me  because  I  lived in  New  York  for  a  long  time  before  coming  to  UCSD. People  are  like,  oh,  New  York  oh  Professor, New  York  is  a  great  city  to  visit  but  not  to  live  in. I'm  like,  well  actually  I  kind  of  lived in  it  and  it  was  okay. So  thinking  a  little  bit  more about  these  larger  processes  and how  we  come  to  the  conclusion that  something  is  good  or  bad,  all  right? Why  is  it  that  we  think  one  neighborhood is  good  and  one  neighborhood  is  bad? Why  is  it  that  we  think  one  house is  good  and  one  house  is  bad? How  do  we  come  to  these  decisions? I  also  think  historical  study  gives  us some  healthy  skepticism  for our  current  day  favorite  fixes. For  instance,  right  now,  the  obsession over  moving  to  electric  energy. Sure,  this  is  great,  and  I own  an  electric  car.  I  believe  in  it  too. But  there  were  a  lot  of  ideas  in the  past  of  these  single  solutions,  these  quick  fixes, the  technological  marvels  that we're  going  to  solve  our  problems. For  instance,  this  is  actually  Broad  acre  city, a  very  famous  picture  by an  architect  named  Frank  Lloyd  Wright, who  believed  this  would  be  the  ideal  city  of the  future  because  we  would  all  ride  around  in  UFOs. Or  this  particular  image up  by  another  architect  named  Korbi, who  argued  that  cars  would  solve  our  problems because  cars  were  the  clean  technology  of  the  future. History  really  gives  us  some  skepticism over  our  quick  fixes. It  reminds  us  that  all  of our  plans  for  today  have  precedence. And  it  gives  us  tools  to  critique and  look  with  skepticism  at  our  plans. And  then  last  but  definitely not  least,  history  reminds  us. And  this  is  making  me  think  of  what  Carrie said  in  her  introduction. History  reminds  us  that  design is  really  about  how  things  are used  and  not  just  how  they are  made  or  supposed  to  be  used,  right? The  ultimate  design  may  not be  what  the  designers  had  in  mind. And  college  students  are  like pro  level  at  doing  this,  right? Using  things  that  were  not designed  to  do  the  things  that  you're  using  them  to  do. So,  for  instance,  the  radiator. Well,  nobody  in  California  has  a  radiator. But  anyway,  the  radiator, that  is  also  a  storage  shelf, the  window  ledge  that  is  also  a  seat, the  steps  that  are  benches,  et  cetera,  et  cetera, All  kinds  of  ways  in  which  students,  again, you  are  the  most  creative  in  terms  of  really pushing  what  it  means  to  think  about  design  by  use, not  design  by  intention. So  I  always  ask  my  students  to  send  me  examples. So  this  is  from  the  last  USP  class. Um,  this  is  an  office  park. This  is  actually  a  dentist,  or  sorry, a  doctor's  office  for  one  of  my  students  from  USP one  last  year  who  you  might  actually  meet  in  the  future. And  she  said,  Professor  Kwok, this  is  a  nice  space,  very  pretty. And  it  was  a  hot  day,  so  I thought  I  should  use  this  space. Design  is  always  about  use  and  not  about  intention. So  I  hope  that  you'll  send  me pictures  in  the  future  of  you  using  spaces. Because  I'm  always  amused  by  this. It's  a  lot  of  fun  that  can  come  from  this. All  right,  So  design  can  only  attempt  to  be  coercive. In  reality,  it  is  always  contested  by  other  designers, by  users  and  by  unintended  users  or  excluded  users. The  challenge  in  this is  for  really  thinking  about  all  of  these  pieces. To  look  at  how  power  is  negotiated, how  we  can  change  our  habitats  to  be  sustainable, beautiful  places  to  live, and  to  think  about  how  history can  inform  the  decisions  that  we  make. All  right,  I've  made my  case  for  why  you  should  take  this  class. I  hope  I'll  see  you  in  the  next  one.  Bye." }
